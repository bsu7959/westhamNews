[{"title":"First Words: Emma Harries","link":"https://www.whufc.com/news/first-words-emma-harries","img":"https://cdn.whufc.com/sites/default/files/2023-08/emmaharries.jpg","content":"Emma Harries is a Hammer!The England U23 international has completed a move to east London after departing Reading at the end of last season, and is West Ham United’s second signing of the summer ahead of the 2023/24 Barclays Women’s Super League campaign.The forward has showcased her ability at playing across the front line for the Royals and scored six goals in 51 WSL outings for Kelly Chambers’ outfit. Harries will now continue her development in Claret and Blue, following Republic of Ireland international Jessie Stapleton in joining the Hammers, and the 21-year-old is excited for the campaign to come at Chigwell Construction Stadium. Fresh from signing her contract with the Irons, Harries sat down with West Ham TV to discuss her move, her career so far, her excitement at working with Rehanne Skinner, and aspirations for the coming season… Emma, welcome to West Ham United! How does it feel to be here?It's amazing to be here. Obviously, this is a huge Club, and I just can't wait to get started. Why do you feel that West Ham was the right step for you?I think that West Ham is a great step for me in my career in terms of developing and pushing myself as a player. Obviously, I'm only 21 so I'm still considered a young player, and I think that West Ham have got some brilliantly experienced players, but they're also pushing youth development. For me, that's really exciting to be a part of.Of course, you were at Reading for many years, since you were eight years old. How does West Ham fit into your journey now?I think West Ham have been a strong team in the WSL for a very long time. I've looked at West Ham and they definitely fit the philosophy that I like to play.Obviously, I've been at Reading since I was just a little girl so it's a big change for me, but one that I'm really looking forward to, and one that I'm definitely going to grab with both hands.I've got a lot to thank Reading for in terms of my development up until now but I believe that West Ham are the team to be able to really push me on to achieve many more things with this great Club. This is your second professional contract in your career. What steps are you now looking to take in terms of your own development?I think for me, my targets are just to push and progress on from the two seasons that I've had. I played numerous times for Reading, so I think for me it's just about finding consistency. And like I said, really pushing myself for a really good Club.I'm really excited for the opportunity and to play with the players here at West Ham. How much are you looking forward to working with Rehanne Skinner?I'm really looking forward to working with her. She's a manager that really instils belief in young players. For me, that's a really positive thing.She used to work at England with the youth age groups so she's worked with some brilliant young talent as well. So I like to think that she would develop me into an even better player for next season.How would you describe yourself as a player?I would describe myself as extremely hard working, with a never-give-up attitude. I would say I'm also a powerful player in and out of possession. And I can promise every West Ham fan that I won't leave any stone unturned on that pitch. You had quite a big injury early last year. Did that change you as a player in any way?That was my first proper injury and rupturing your PCL was obviously not a nice one to do but I definitely think it's made me more resilient and more tough skinned.Like I said, every time I step out on the pitch I'm extremely privileged to be in that position to play. Coming back from an injury, it'll be really good to put that in the past and really tackle this season head on. We're looking towards the start of the season now. How much are you looking forward to being back out on the grass?I can't wait. Personally, I find training on my own extremely boring so I can't wait to be training with the rest of the girls.I've only been in for a couple of days and the staff and the players here are lovely people and I just can't wait to play with them and start my journey here at West Ham. "},{"title":"Inside Rush Green | 1v1s, 2v2s & 3v3s!","link":"https://www.whufc.com/news/inside-rush-green-1v1s-2v2s-3v3s","img":"https://cdn.whufc.com/sites/default/files/2023-08/inside_training_16x9_home010823.jpg","content":"West Ham TV was at Rush Green to capture individual and small-sided battles on the training pitches!The Hammers complete their pre-season schedule with a trip to Germany to face Bundesliga side and fellow UEFA Europa League qualifiers Bayer Leverkusen.To prepare them for this challenge, David Moyes and his coaches put his players through their paces in two fitness-building sessions on Tuesday.  "},{"title":"Highlights: Stade Rennais 3-1 West Ham United","link":"https://www.whufc.com/news/highlights-stade-rennais-3-1-west-ham-united","img":"https://cdn.whufc.com/sites/default/files/2023-07/highlightsrennais1220.jpg","content":"This content is from an external website which may store Social Media & YouTube cookies you have not consented to.West Ham United suffered a first defeat of pre-season on Saturday as Stade Rennais secured a 3-1 win in an entertaining contest at Roazhon Park.The French side took an early lead through Baptiste Santamaria’s stunning long-range strike, but West Ham worked their way back into the contest and levelled midway through the second half thanks to Tomáš Souček’s towering header from a free-kick.However, Rennes went again and re-took the lead 15 minutes from time when France U21 international Arnaud Kalimuendo flicked home from close range.The Hammers valiantly pushed for another equaliser but, right at the end, the unfortunate Angelo Ogbonna put through his own goal as the hosts claimed victory in north-western France.Check out highlights in the video player above. "},{"title":"Watch live -

We also got to pat some kangaroos, too, and the animals are very beautiful. I was offered the chance to hold a wombat, but I was happy to hold the koala, that was enough!”Australia is home to thousands of species which are unique to the country, with over 80 per cent of animals found nowhere else in the world in the wild. Among them are kangaroos, dingoes, wallabies, wombats, koalas and quokkas.Kangaroos, wallabies, wombats and quokkas are all marsupials, which means they give birth to relatively undeveloped young that grow in a pouch located on their mothers’ abdomen before going out into the world on their own. Dingoes are wild dogs which live in small packs across much of Australia.Quokkas live only on Rottnest Island, located eleven miles off the coast of the Perth suburb of Fremantle, and a small number of other areas of Western Australia and the cat-sized animals are a symbol of the State.“It’s a family park and keeps us busy with about 2,000 animals to look after, made up of about 200 different species, with the emphasis being on interaction and for our guests to be able to touch and feel and get up close and feed some of them and learn about them and enjoy the experience,” said manager Debbie Morley, whose parents opened Caversham Park.“We’ve got some very common animals like kangaroos, right through to critically endangered species most people have never heard of and obviously it’s very important to protect all species because they face all threats out in the wild.“We are delighted that West Ham paid us a visit and the players had fun meeting the animals and followed Serena Williams and Roger Federer in holding one of our koalas! We missed people for three years during COVID, but we’ve got through it now and it’s onwards and upwards and onto the future.”To find out more about these wonderful animals, visit the Caversham Wildlife Park website here. "},{"title":"Buy your match pass to watch us take on Tottenham

It was good to get out there and enjoy some football. “The legs have been better! We’ve been back for four or five days and it’s been really tough, but that’s the nature of pre-season. That’s what we expect. It was nice to play in a game, so it wasn’t just running. We could get on the ball and play a bit of football, which was lovely.”For all the running and drills on the Rush Green training pitches in the last few days, Downes explained how playing in actual matches is the best way to fully prepare for the new season; one that will once again see the side compete on four fronts, including Europe for a third consecutive campaign.“There is nothing quite like football fitness. It’s the little things like the sharpness, the second balls. It’s those little things that you can’t get in training, that you can’t replicate when you’re running.“Things like change in direction like you get in games, it’s so different. We need to play as many games as we can and, to be fair, all the boys prefer doing that. It was good.”The 24-year-old was one of 12 members of the senior West Ham squad to feature against The Wood, with a host of talent from the Academy of Football also playing a role in the fixture. Each youngster sought to make an impression on manager David Moyes and the first-team coaching staff, with midfielder Swyer and striker Kodua both getting on the scoresheet.“The young lads bring a lot of energy and they’re very good players,” Downes continued. “The U18s won the FA Youth Cup last year, which shows the talent we’ve got here. They’ve put on a good showing here at Boreham Wood so I’m buzzing for them.”Victory at Boreham Wood was the first in a comprehensive pre-season calendar for the Hammers, one that next sees the Irons travel to Australia for two matches before further contests against Dagenham & Redbridge, French Ligue 1 side Rennes and Bundesliga outfit Bayer Leverkusen. As such, Downes is eager to make the most of these fixtures and the hard work on the training pitches in the coming weeks, in order to ensure the best possible start to the campaign.“I think, last year, we didn’t have the best start to the season,” he reflected. “I felt like it was always a little bit of an uphill battle and you can’t do that in the Premier League.“This season, we’re putting in the hard work now so we do start well. We want to pick up points early doors and, to do that, we need to have some momentum going into the season. That’s what we’re hoping to do and I’m sure that’s what we do.”Downes and his teammates head Down Under this week for the next leg of their pre-season schedule, on a tour that will see the side face A-League outfit Perth Glory at Optus Stadium on Saturday 15 July, before a London derby against Tottenham Hotspur, again at Optus Stadium, on Tuesday 18 July.“I can’t wait for Australia,” the midfielder added. “I am dreading the flight a little bit but I can’t wait. I’ve never been before but I’m really looking forward to it. I’ve heard it’s a lovely place and I’m ready to get going.” "},{"title":"Highlights: Boreham Wood 1-4 West Ham United","link":"https://www.whufc.com/news/highlights-boreham-wood-1-4-west-ham-united","img":"https://cdn.whufc.com/sites/default/files/2023-07/highlights_v_boreham_wood_.jpg","content":"West Ham United got their 2023/24 pre-season off to a comfortable start as the Hammers claimed a 4-1 win at National League side Boreham Wood. Two goals in either half was enough for David Moyes' men to secure victory in their first match of a busy pre-season schedule, with striker Danny Ings opening the scoring with a curling, first-time effort on 25 minutes. The Irons doubled the advantage on the stroke of half-time when Pablo Fornals whipped in a tremendous cross, which was met by the oncoming Kamarai Swyer. The midfielder's late, bursting run permitted him to meet the ball with a powerful header, securing a two-goal lead at the interval. Substitute Jarrod Bowen added the third from close range on 78 minutes, tapping in Conor Coventry's rocketed, low cross, before fellow substitute Gideon Kodua added West Ham's fourth with the goal of the evening; controlling Bowen's lofted pass with his chest before sweetly netting on the volley. There was still time for Boreham Wood to add a late consolation. The hosts found their finish through Femi Ilesanmi, whose swerving shot from distance deceived Joseph Anang in the West Ham goal. Check out full highlights from our 4-1 win in the video player above!"},{"title":"Swyer: When you get an opportunity you have to try and take it","link":"https://www.whufc.com/news/swyer-when-you-get-opportunity-you-have-try-and-take-it","img":"https://cdn.whufc.com/sites/default/files/2023-07/kamarai_swyer_reax_new_whtv.jpg","content":"Kamarai Swyer’s first 45 minutes of the 2023/24 pre-season couldn’t have gone much better. The 20-year-old was named in David Moyes’ starting Xi for the opening pre-season match ahead of the new campaign, which saw the Hammers head to Meadow Park to take on National League side Boreham Wood for the second year in succession. Swyer joined fellow Academy of Football talent Levi Laing in team that began the action in Hertfordshire on Monday evening, whilst a number of other young prospects joined Jarrod Bowen and Emerson Palmieri on the substitutes bench. Whilst Swyer is no stranger to Hammers fans, having made his first team debut in the UEFA Europa Conference League last season in the 3-0 win over FCSB, they had yet to see him notch a goal in Claret & Blue in a first-team fixture, until now. The winger ghosted in off the right-hand flank and met a brilliantly delivered cross from Pablo Fornals with superb precision, powering a header beyond Wood goalkeeper Nathan Ashmore for the Hammers’ second of the night.  Swyer was pleased to take his chance, and hopes that more will follow when heads out to Australia with the squad this week. “It’s not a bad way to start at all,” the youngster smiled, speaking to West Ham TV after the match. “I thought that it was quite a tough first half, everyone was getting back into it and getting used to being back out on the pitch again. “The chance came and I was pleased that it did, Pablo had the ball and I just tried to get across the front of the defenders and luckily I did that and finished it as well. “You don’t often get many chances because we have some many talented players in the first-team squad, so when you do get an opportunity you have to try and take it.”The Irons have only been back in pre-season training since Thursday, meaning that this match came earlier than in their pre-season schedule than previous years, as First Team Coach Billy McKinlay explained. For Swyer, though, there’s no better feeling that getting back out onto the pitch and getting those all important minutes into the legs in preparation for another long season of highs and lows. He’s hoping that hard work will continue to present him with opportunities to impress.“Pre-season has been good, we’ve been back for five or so days now and it’s been really good, but tough. “There’s nothing quite like being on the pitch. We do the training and the runs, work in the gym – but when you’re playing in a game it’s just a different experience. It was great to be back out there tonight. “Now we look forward to the trip to Australia, it’s somewhere I’ve never been so I’m happy to be going and excited to be involved in the trip. “For me personally I have to keep building, working on my game and keep doing the same things that I’ve been doing recently and working hard,” he concluded."},{"title":"McKinlay: Boreham Wood win was a good workout","link":"https://www.whufc.com/news/mckinlay-boreham-wood-win-was-good-workout","img":"https://cdn.whufc.com/sites/default/files/2023-07/billy_match_reaction_bwood.jpg","content":"First team coach Billy McKinlay believes West Ham United's 4-1 victory over Boreham Wood was a good workout for the side in their opening pre-season fixture.The Hammers only returned back from the summer break on Thursday, yet were already back on the field on Monday evening, facing off against the National League outfit at Meadow Park. Nine first-team players started the game in Hertfordshire, with David Moyes' bench comprising of a number of Academy of Football talents. It would be the experienced Danny Ings that would be first to open the scoring, with the forward rifling a strike beyond the impressive Nathan Ashmore on 25 minutes. 20-year-old Kamarai Swyer would make his mark with a bullet header just before the break, which was added to by Jarrod Bowen in the second half when he prodded home from close range. FA Youth Cup winning Captain Gideon Kodua scored the pick of the goals – taking a cross on his chest before turning and placing a shot past Ashmore and into the opposite corner. Boreham Wood defender Femi Ilesanmi would add a consolation with moments remaining when his effort from distance beat Anang before the final whistle sounded. McKinlay was pleased with the opening workout and is looking forward to the team now traveling out to Australia for pre-season tour of Western Australia on Tuesday.We’re back into it really quicklyThe close season always goes quickly and the boys have come back on a high. We’ve had a really good first few days and it’s great to be back ready to go again this season. The Gaffer has had to change pre-season a little bit because of the nature of the first couple of weeks. We go to Australia tomorrow where we have two games coming up quickly, so tonight’s game is little bit earlier on in pre-season than in previous years.  Tonight was a really good workoutFirst of all the fitness aspect was really good, and obviously we got a decent performance and a good win too. Fitness is the key element in the early part of pre-season, and we have to be a little bit careful because of the game being a couple of days earlier than we had it in previous seasons, which means there could be a bigger risk of injury so we have to be careful on a number of aspects. I think physiologically it’s good for the players to get that first action over and done with, and now they can concentrate on progressing with their fitness levels. The Academy lads had a brilliant season last yearThere’s a lot of emerging talent and we have high hopes for them. They got their opportunity tonight with the international boys not available yet and they have to take those opportunities when they come around. It was good to see them in action tonight.  Being out in Australia will be a good experienceThat’s what happens these days, you’re flying all around the world and it’ll be a good experience. We’ve had the game here and now we head out there for two matches and we’ll get ourselves ready to keep progressing.  "},{"title":"Inside Rush Green | Irons return for 2023/24 pre-season","link":"https://www.whufc.com/news/inside-rush-green-irons-return-202324-pre-season","img":"https://cdn.whufc.com/sites/default/files/2023-07/insiderushgreenfirstday1220.png","content":"West Ham United’s Rush Green Training Ground was a hive of excitement and activity as members of the first-team squad returned for the first day of pre-season on Thursday. Senior players who were not involved in international football during the summer underwent screening and scanning as head of medical services Richard Collinge and his staff checked the health of each player and set their data benchmarks for the coming season.The involved players underwent cardiac checks, concussion tests, and a general physiotherapy screening before getting down to work in the gym.
